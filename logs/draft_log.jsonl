The total cost for implementation is $5,000. This is a one-time fee that covers all the activities required to get your system up and running smoothly.\n\n2. **Ongoing Costs:**\n   Our ongoing costs are primarily based on a per-profile billing model, which we find to be the most straightforward and scalable approach. A profile is defined as one product or vehicle in one database. For example, having 5 vehicles in 10 databases would constitute 50 profiles. The cost per profile is $100 annually. Therefore, the total ongoing cost would depend on the number of profiles you need to manage. For instance, managing 50 profiles would equate to $5,000 annually.\n\n   To ensure total clarity, here is how the ongoing cost calculation works:\n   - Number of profiles: 50\n   - Cost per profile: $100\n   - Total annual cost: 50 profiles x $100 = $5,000\n\n3. **Cost for Individual Licenses:**\n   Each module within our system can be licensed individually, and the cost per license per year is as follows:\n   - Module A: $500 per license\n   - Module B: $750 per license\n   - Module C: $600 per license\n\n   These costs apply irrespective of the number of profiles but are dependent on the specific functionalities and capabilities each module provides.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n   Our contracts are annual with pricing guaranteed for two years. We are committed to reducing costs through continuous software development and automation. As our scalability increases, costs are driven down, and these savings are passed directly onto our clients. Any price reductions are applied immediately to benefit our clients at the earliest possible.\n\nPlease let us know if you need further details or a more customized quote based on specific needs or the number of profiles/modules you are considering. We are here to assist and ensure you receive the most effective and efficient service.", "timestamp": "2025-04-24T10:12:01.725478"}
