To prevent data loss, we back up our systems daily to off-site servers. Our employee policy strictly prohibits personal use of company resources, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\nFurthermore, APX Stream is committed to creating a safe and respectful work environment by having a detailed anti-harassment and anti-discriminatory policy in place.
